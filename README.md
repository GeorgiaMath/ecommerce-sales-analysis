# E-commerce Sales Analysis

This project was developed as part of my MSc in Market and Production Mathematics at the Athens University of Economics and Business. 
The goal was to simulate the role of a data analytics manager in an e-commerce company and extract insights that can support strategic business decisions.

All analysis, visualizations, and modeling were implemented using Python from scratch without automated tools.

## Dataset
The dataset includes customer transactions, product categories, unit prices, revenues, marketing campaigns, sales platform, customer region, age group, and gender. 

These data are entirely anonymized and do not contain any personally identifiable information such as names, emails, or contact details. 
They are used solely for educational and analytical purposes within the context of this academic project.
